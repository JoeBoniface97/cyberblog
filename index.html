        <p>
            I'm starting this blog as I dive headfirst into the cyber security field with no prior experience! This is a
      place where I'll be sharing my experience and thoughts on this new journey. I eagerly await sharing with you all!

                <h3>Cyber security bootcamp experience</h3>
                <h4>Cyber Security, Linux, Cryptography, GRC, OSI</h4>
                <p>I jumped straight into a 6 month Cyber Security bootcamp course and here is how it went! I had no prior experience with cyber or even computers for
                    that matter, but I took a chance. I've always had big dreams of making it big in the heavy metal music industry however, I needed to be more
realistic. I work for Pratt & Whitney and luckily they covered my tuition. So I started this course with literally no idea of what to expect or how challenging it would
              be. We've done deep dives into a plethora of topics such as GRC framework, Linux terminal, building networks, firewalls, Cryptography, network security.
 We've studied and learned everything from the fundamentals of cybersecurity to actually putting everything into practice. Surprisingly, I found quite a few topics genuinely interesting. I was more so into the cryptography aspect and I enjoyed linux although its complicated and difficult at times and lastly I did actually enjoy setting up networks using Azure. All in all this course has thrown me a newbie to all things computers for a ringer but I could say I'll walk away from this course satisfied and feeling accomplished and excited about my future in the tech industry.               </p>

                <h3>Intrusion detection and prevention systems, what's the difference?</h3>
                <h4>IDS IPS HIDS NIDS Network</h4>
                <p>
                   Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools designed to detect and respond to unauthorized activities or potential threats within a computer
 network or system.
 IDS play a crucial role in network security by monitoring network traffic, analyzing system events, and identifying suspicious or malicious behavior.
  IDS use various detection methods to identify potential intrusions. These methods include signature-based detection,
 which compares network traffic or system events against a database of known attack patterns, and anomaly-based detection, which establishes
 a baseline of normal behavior and alerts when deviations occur. IDS can be classified into two main categories: Network-based IDS (NIDS) and Host-based IDS (HIDS). 
NIDS monitor network traffic at strategic points within the network infrastructure, such as switches or routers, to detect attacks targeting the network. 
HIDS, on the other hand, are installed on individual host systems and monitor activities occurring on the host, such as log files, system calls, or file integrity. 



Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are advanced security solutions that go beyond intrusion detection and actively work to prevent and block malicious activities within
 a computer network or system. The primary goal of an IPS is to actively prevent and block malicious activities in real-time. 
It analyzes network traffic, system events, and application behavior to identify known attack patterns or anomalies. 
When a threat is detected, the IPS can automatically take action to block the malicious traffic, terminate connections, or apply access control rules to prevent
 further compromise. IPS uses both signature-based and behavior-based detection methods. 
Signature-based detection involves comparing network traffic or system events against a database of known attack signatures or patterns. 
 Behavior-based detection focuses on identifying abnormal activities or deviations from the established baseline behavior, which may indicate an ongoing attack. 


In conclusion there are many differences between IDS and IPS and each serve a vital purpose in cyber security.
